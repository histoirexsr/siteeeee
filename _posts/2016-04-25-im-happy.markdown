Download & Customize Easy
Want to manage and host Font Awesome assets yourself? You can download, customize, and use the icons and default styling manually. Both CSS and CSS Preprocessor (Sass and Less) formats are included.

 Download
Using CSS
Copy the entire font-awesome directory into your project.
In the <head> of your html, reference the location to your font-awesome.min.css.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css">

Using Sass or Less
Use this method to customize Font Awesome 4.7.0 using LESS or SASS.

Copy the font-awesome/ directory into your project.
Open your project's font-awesome/less/variables.less or font-awesome/scss/_variables.scss and edit the @fa-font-path or $fa-font-path variable to point to your font directory.
@fa-font-path:   "../font";
 The font path is relative from your compiled CSS directory.

Re-compile your LESS or SASS if using a static compiler. Otherwise, you should be good to go.
