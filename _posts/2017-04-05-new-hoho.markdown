Oh well, Taobao is a good friend, there’re all sorts of nice stuff if you’re willing to dig them out. Many of those shops strive for success under the infamous copycat image China created.

aG haha this is so fun

This time I got myself 2 pair of earrings, one is `handmade 925 silver button style earring`, the other is `hand painted enamel flower from Les Nerides` (idk if that’s authentic tho).

I think the overall quality of both earring is beyond my expectation, despite minor flaws, but hey, its affordable!
